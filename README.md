# Browser Operating Agent

This project demonstrates a basic autonomous agent that operates its own browser using Playwright.

## Features
- Launches a browser instance
- Navigates to a web page
- Interacts with page elements

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Python 3.12+ is installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install playwright
   python -m playwright install
   ```
3. Run the agent:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Next Steps
- Expand agent logic for more complex tasks
- Add decision-making and page analysis
